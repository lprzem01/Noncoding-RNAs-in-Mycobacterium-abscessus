# Analysis of Unannotated Expressed Regions in Transcriptomic Data from Mycobacterium Abscessus 
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
<p> This repository provides all supplementary information, figures, detailed analysis results, and reproducible scripts used at each stage of RNA-seq data processing and downstream analysis pipeline. The workflow documented here includes raw data quality control (QC), preprocessing (trimming), mapping/alignment, and downstream analysis using BaerHunter and DESeq2.</p>
# SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
•	Supplementary tables with detailed statistics and sample metadata
•	Additional figures illustrating QC metrics, mapping statistics, and differential expression tables

## PIPELINE OVERVIEW
The data analysis workflow proceeds through the following stages:
  1.	Quality control (QC) of raw sequence data
  2.	Adapter and quality trimming of reads
  3.	Mapping/alignment to a reference genome
  4.  Annotation of novel ncRNAs using Baerhunter 
  5.	Quantification of gene/transcript abundance
  6.	Differential expression analysis using BaerHunter and DESeq2
  7.	Visualization and figure preparation

## SOFTWARE AND REQUIREMENTS
To replicate the analysis, ensure the following software is installed:
•	Python (≥ 3.6) and R (≥ 4.0.0)
•	FastQC for initial QC
•	Fastp t for adapter/quality trimming
•	BWA for read alignment
•	Samtools for BAM manipulation
•	BaerHunter for ncRNA prediction
•	DESeq2 (R/Bioconductor) for differential expression analysis
•	ggplot2, pheatmap, and other R packages for visualization
See  sessionInfo.txt for exact package versions.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
•	Clone the repository:
•	git clone [URL]
•	Install required dependencies (see above)
•	Download required datasets using the scripts provided
•	Review quality, trim and map the raw data to reference genome
•	Utilise the main script file to analyse processed data with Baerhunter and Deseq2
